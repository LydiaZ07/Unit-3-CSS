# Setting up Netlify:

1. Sign into Netlify through your github account.

2. Create a new site from Git.

3. Choose continuous deployment from GitHub.

4. Choose your repo.

5. Don't worry about the base directory or build command for now, for the publish directory select the folder that your html and css file are located in, in most cases this will be the dist folder, but that isn't always the case.

6. Deploy your site!

7. After deploying your site you can access the site settings and change your site name in order to change the url.
